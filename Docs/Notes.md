# Valuable Pieces of Information

## View and Laterality

Generally, mammography is conducted with 2 views (from 2 angles), because the position of breast cancer is various, although the upper outer quadrant of the breast is the most common site of breast cancer occurrence. But the shape of the breast is almost the same regardless of different views. Moreover, the left and right breast generally have the same view. Therefore, we ignore the laterality and view for the machine learning purpose. The patient of the test data has no implant, so patients having implant can be excluded from the train data set. However, this patient has no risk of false positive for cancer because of implant. Although it is unknown whether the other patients in the hidden test data set have an implant, generally few patients have implant. Thus, implant appears to have little influence on this machine learning.
